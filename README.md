Code for front-end Web. 
In this project, I wrote the HTML and CSS code to display different pages for a website about architecture. Firstly, I did the text display using HTML. Secondly, I applied CSS to mak styles and effects for text. Finally, reponsive features for different sizes of devices were used to adjust the looking of the website across different devices.
