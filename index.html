            <p>Churchill House, at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/216+Northbourne+Ave,+Braddon+ACT+2612/@-35.2625689,149.1319773,3a,75y,97.97h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFwV5IOpKhEK8wF4IvfRJyQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b16529963e13b9f:0xb9ccb51b821263b1!8m2!3d-35.2626411!4d149.1326108" class="external-link" target="_blank">216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon</a>, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>

                <img class="body-image" src="assets/images/churchill-house-19.jpg" alt="churchill house plan">
            <p>Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia.</p>
